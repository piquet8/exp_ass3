#    This node receives the hints published on the topic hint from the oracle node. Then it    
#    check them: if the hint is not already present in the ontology it adds it.                 
#    After that it checks if the hint has already been saved in the ontology, if it is the 
#    first time the hint has been received it checks if the hypothesy that correspond to that  
#    hint ID is complete and not inconsistent. In case the hypothesis is right it sends it to
#    the robot. When one hint belongs to a hypothesis already check the node print Manage 
#    Hypothesis: information source with this ID already checked
